# Final_Project
Time_Series_Analysis_For_Stock_Prediction
## Data collection:
•	To understand how things change over time, we looked at different sites for information. We used sources like google dataset search, world bank open data, GitHub, climate data online and Kaggle. These places have lots of different datasets, and we picked one from there for our study.
## Data analysis:
•	Application of time series analysis to identify patterns and trends. Implementation of the regression models and Arima model to predict the differences.
## Modeling and evaluation:
### Arima model:
The ARIMA model is like a super tool used in math to predict future values in a sequence of numbers. It is especially great for things like predicting stock prices or weather patterns. This tool has three important parts:
•	Autoregressive part
•	Integrated part.
•	Moving average (ma) part: 
•	We write the ARIMA model as ARIMA (p, d, q)
### Linear regression model:
Linear regression in time series analysis for stock market prediction is a technique used to establish a relationship between the dependent variable (stock price) and independent variables (predictors) to forecast future prices. It provides insights into the impact of different factors on stock prices
